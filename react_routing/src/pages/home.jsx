        Welcome to the <strong>Frontend Development Bootcamp.</strong> This is
        one of the most comprehensive bootcamp available online. So, if you are
        new to web development, thats great news because starting from scratch
        is always easy. And if you have tried some other courses before, you
        already know that <strong>web development</strong> is not easy. This is
        because of 2 reasons. Either the web development course might be missing
        projects, or might be focusing on too many things at a time. When you
        focus on everything, in a short duration of time, it is very tough be a
        great developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        To become a full stack web developer, you need to learn the following
        concepts:
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
          <li>React (for frontend)</li>
          <li>Node (for backend)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This course gives you a unique experience and focus only on front end
        web development. First we will get professional and free web development
        tools, then we will start with <strong>HTML</strong>. Once we cover this
        ground, we will take down our very first challenge. Further we will
        learn <strong>HTML 5 </strong>and start our first project.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving further we will take <strong>CSS and CSS3.</strong> After that we
        will have a complete and dedicated section on projects. After that we
        will learn Bootstrap and optimise our sites for mobile view. After that
        we will learn <strong>ReactJS Components and Routing</strong> and will
        do some projects in that.
