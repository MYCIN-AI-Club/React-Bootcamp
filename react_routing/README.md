This a simple project in React to demonstrate some important concepts of React, like:

- Creating reusable components
- Using Bootstrap to style components
- Nesting of components
- Passing props to components
- State management of components
- Hooks in react
- Routing between different pages
- Creating routes using different components

This project helped me learn these concepts very efficiently.
